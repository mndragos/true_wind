## True Wind ##

You can compute true wind by entering numerical data
regarding apparent wind and vessel.

All wind speeds are intended to be in knots, but any unit can be used so long as
the boat speed and the wind speeds are in the same units, ie miles per hour, km
per hour, or meters per second.

## Definitions ##

~ Wind direction ~
This name generally refers to the true wind blowing across the land or across the
water. In this case, it is always the direction from which the wind is blowing. A
north wind blows from the north, toward the south.

~ Apparent wind ~
The wind we actually feel or the vessel feels when moving. It is a combination of
the true wind and the effective wind created by our motion. If our speed is zero,
the apparent wind is the same as the true wind. The apparent wind is described by
the apparent wind speed and the apparent wind angle.

~ Apparent wind angle (AWA) ~
The direction of the apparent wind relative to the head of the vessel, usually listed
as port or starboard. It varies from 0° (wind on the bow), through 90° (wind on thebeam), 
on around to 180° (wind on the stern).

~ Apparent wind speed (AWS) ~
The speed of the wind in knots that we measure from a moving vessel. It is a
combination of the true wind speed and the effective wind we create with our
motion.

~ True wind angle (TWA) ~
The direction of the true wind relative to the head of the vessel, usually listed as
port or starboard. It varies from 0° (wind on the bow), through 90° (wind on the
beam), on around to 180° (wind on the stern).

~ True wind speed (TWS) ~
This is the actual speed of the wind over the water. Generally it is expressed in
knots.

~ Speed (S) ~
This is usually just your boat speed through the water as measured by a knotmeter,
when in strong current parallel to your heading, however, it could be more accurate
to use speed over ground (SOG) as measured with the GPS.

~ Heading ~
The best thing to enter here is the true heading of the vessel, that is, if steering a
compass course, correct the compass course first with the variation so you can
input here your actual true heading at the time the wind data was collected.
